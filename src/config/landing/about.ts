		"We founded Featurebase at the end of 2020 because the way we collected feedback at our previous startup was a mess.",
		"The old tools in the customer feedback space were incredibly expensive, stagnant in development, and the interfaces sucked.",
		"So we thought, what would a 10x better solution look like?",
		"We ended up with something that's much more than just a feedback tool. It's a space where companies can keep everyone informed about what they're working on and collaborate with their users in an organized way to build better products.",
